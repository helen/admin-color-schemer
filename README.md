Create your own admin color scheme, right in the WordPress admin.

## Description ##

Create your own admin color scheme, right in the WordPress admin. Go simple with the four basic colors, or get into the details and customize to your heart's content.

## Installation ##

Admin Color Schemer is most easily installed automatically via the Plugins tab in your dashboard. Your uploads folder also needs to be writeable in order to save the scheme.

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### Why do I have to click a button to preview? ###

The preview currently operates by generating a complete stylesheet and reloading it. While in some environments this happens near-instantaneously, the time and resources it takes to reflect a change is not ideal for live previews. We do hope to solve this in the future.

### I'm getting an ugly screen asking me for a username and password. ###

This means that your uploads folder requires credentials in order to save the the scheme files. If you're not sure how to fix that, please try the [support forums](http://wordpress.org/support/). We'll also work on making this prompt more beautiful in the future.
